# Week 2
## Reading
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) (chapters 1-4)
- [Introduction to Programming in Python](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/home/) (some exercises will be from this book)

_These are merely suggestions for how to get started with Python and Jupyter. If you feel these sources are not doing a good job then don't hesitate to browse for other books, tutorials and blog posts. There are plenty of good ressources out there._

## Exercises
### Python brush-up
These exercises are meant for you to brush up on your Python. Exercises *without* a star you can submit them to CodeJudge (LINK TO CODEJUDGE).

From [Introduction to Programming in Python](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/home/), solve 

- 1.1.1, 1.1.6
- 1.2.2*, 1.2.5*, 1.2.8*, 1.2.11

### Predicting survival on the Titanic
Download the [training data](https://github.com/patrickcording/02807-comp-tools/blob/master/docker/work/data/titanic_train.csv) for the [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) case on Kaggle and use Jupyter for exploring it and preparing it for training of a model. 

You should make sure that you understand the data. Read the description on Kaggle carefully. 

Next, explore the data. You can ask yourself questions like: which features are more likely to influence a passengers chance of survival? How will you investigate this?  

Next week you will train a model with your data, so you should also prepare your data for modelling. You should consider the following:
- Do features have the correct data types?
- How will you handle missing values?
- Are there features you should not include?
- Is cleaning needed for any of the features?
- Can you think of other feature engineering that might have an impact? (hint: cabin number)
