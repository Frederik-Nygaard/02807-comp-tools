# Week 2
## Reading
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) (chapters 1-4)
- [Introduction to Programming in Python](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/home/) (some exercises will be from this book)

## Exercises
### Python brush-up
Solve the following exercises from [Introduction to Programming in Python](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/home/).

Note: Many of the exercises are asking you to read input from the command line. You may use Jupyter and solve these exercises by defining a function that takes the input as a parameter instead.

- 1.1.1
- 1.2.2, 1.2.5, 1.2.8, 1.2.11
- 1.3.6, 1.3.7, 1.3.13, 1.3.28
- 1.4.2, 1.4.12, 1.4.C2, 1.4.C10
- 2.1.4, 2.1.15, 2.1.16
- 2.3.2, 2.3.C3
- 3.2.1 (without the draw function), 3.2.5, 3.2.7
- 4.1.C4, 4.1.C7, 4.2.2

### Predicting survival on the Titanic
Download the [training data](https://github.com/patrickcording/02807-comp-tools/blob/master/docker/work/data/titanic_train.csv) for the [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) case on Kaggle and use Jupyter for exploring it and preparing it for training of a model. 

You should make sure that you understand the data. Read the description on Kaggle carefully. 

Next, explore the data. You can ask yourself questions like: which features are more likely to influence a passengers chance of survival? How will you investigate this?  

Next week you will train a model with your data, so you should also prepare your data for modelling. You should consider the following:
- Do features have the correct data types?
- How will you handle missing values?
- Are there features you should not include?
- Is cleaning needed for any of the features?
- Can you think of other feature engineering that might have an impact? (hint: cabin number)
