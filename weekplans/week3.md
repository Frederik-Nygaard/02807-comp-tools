## Exercises
### Getting data from an API

### Creating a crawler

### Predicting survival on the Titanic (EDA and data prep)
If you didn't finish the data exploration and preparation last week, then continue with this now.

_For inspiration, you may look at how [others](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks) have done this. [This](https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/titanic-survival-predictions-beginner) is a very clean, beginner-friendly notebook._

### Predicting survival on the Titanic (training a model)
Use scikit-learn to train a model for predicting survival on the Titanic.

The problem type is binary classification (did a passenger survice or die?). You should chose a number of different models for binary classification and compare their accuracy. To do so, be sure to split your data into training and validation and only feed the training data to your models.

Which model do you chose, and why?
